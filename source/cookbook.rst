Cookbook Recipes
================
 
Recipes are presented for different scenarios. If you are looking for
something specific, dive right in, as each section can be read
independently. However, alternative approaches that are common to
multiple recipes are generally presented in most detail in the
earliest such recipe. Thus, there is some value in reading the recipes
in order, especially for new users.

Recording analog signals
------------------------

* :ref:`Recording a single analog signal <cookbook-a1>`
* :ref:`Recording multiple analog signals simultaneously <cookbook-a2>`

Recording digital and mixed signals
-----------------------------------

* :ref:`Recording digital signals <cookbook-dig>`  
* :ref:`Recording analog and digital signals simultaneously <cookbook-mix>`

Discontinuous recording
-----------------------
  
* :ref:`Episodic recording <cookbook-episodic>`
* :ref:`Using triggers <cookbook-trig>`

Generating output
-----------------
  
* :ref:`PicoDAQ as a pulse generator <cookbook-pulseoutput>`
* :ref:`PicoDAQ as a function generator <cookbook-funcoutput>`
* :ref:`Nonparametric output <cookbook-sampleout>`
* :ref:`Generating multiple outputs synchronously <cookbook-output2>`

Combined input and output
-------------------------

*  Combining input and output cookbook-inout
*  Discontinuous output? Episodic/triggered in/out combo?
