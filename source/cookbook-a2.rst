Recipes for recording from multiple analog sources
==================================================

Reading a short segment from two channels
-----------------------------------------

Read 200 ms worth of data from channels “ai0” and “ai1” with a
sampling frequency of 50 kilohertz and display the results using
matplotlib:

.. literalinclude :: _static/code/cookbook/recipe_a2a.py

.. image:: _static/imgs/cookbook/recipe_a2a.png
   :width: 500
   :align: center

(The “TTL” output from my cheap function generator isn’t very clean.)

The resulting ``data`` is a T×C array where T is the sample count and
C is the number of channels.


Retrieving time stamps
----------------------

.. literalinclude :: _static/code/cookbook/recipe_a2b.py

.. image:: _static/imgs/cookbook/recipe_a2b.png
   :width: 500
   :align: center


The ``times`` return value is still a simple T-vector.


Retrieving raw data
-------------------

Retrieving raw data from multiple channels is equally straightforward:

.. code-block::

    with AnalogIn(channels=[0, 1], rate=50*kHz) as ai:
        data = ai.read(200*ms, raw=True)

The result is a T×C array of 16-bit integers.


Edge cases
----------

It is perfectly legitimate to record a single channel in this way:

.. code-block::

    with AnalogIn(channels=[0], rate=50*kHz) as ai:
        data = ai.read(200*ms)

The result is a T×1 array. In contrast, if you record a single channel
with

.. code-block::

    with AnalogIn(channel=0, rate=50*kHz) as ai:
        data = ai.read(200*ms)

the result is a T-vector.

It is even OK to record from no channels at all:

.. code-block::

    with AnalogIn(channels=[], rate=50*kHz) as ai:
        data = ai.read(200*ms)

The result is a T×0 array. This behavior is mostly useful if your use
of AnalogIn is embedded in a function that receives its *channels*
parameter from an external source.
