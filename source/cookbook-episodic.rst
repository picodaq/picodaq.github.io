Recipes for recording short chunks of data at regular intervals
===============================================================

Periodically recording a short chunk from an analog channel
-----------------------------------------------------------

The *episodic* method on AnalogIn and DigitalIn may be used to record
short segments of data at fixed intervals:

.. literalinclude :: _static/code/cookbook/recipe_epi1a.py

In this case, we record 20 milliseconds, 10 times per second (i.e.,
once every 100 ms). Note the absence of an argument to the *read*
method: this implies reading precisely one episode worth of data.

If the source frequency had been exactly 100 hertz, the recorded
signals would lie on top of one another. As it is, there is a
systematic drift between traces:

In the real world, episodic recording has two main purposes:

1. Recording multiple channels at such a high sampling rate that the
   USB connection could not keep up;

2. Recording responses to periodic stimulation.


Episodic recording with mixed signals
-------------------------------------
   
When combining analog with digital inputs and/or inputs with outputs,
you only need to call *episodic* on one of the streams; the call
applies automatically to the others. For instance:

.. code-block::

    K = 20
    adata = []
    ddata = []
    with AnalogIn(channel=0, rate=100*kHz) as ai:
        with DigitalIn(line=0, rate=100*kHz) as di:
            ai.episodic(duration=20*ms, period=100*ms)
            for k in range(K):
                adata.append(ai.read())
                ddata.append(di.read())

This simultaneously reads from “ai0” and “di0” for 20 ms out of every 100 ms.
